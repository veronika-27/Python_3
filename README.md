# Python_3

There are 4 small Python projects I have made during some courses. 

API.py-The program prompts for a location, contacts a web service and retrieves JSON for the web service and parses that data, and retrieves the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.

music.py- The program creates SQLite local database file after finding the needed data from an xml file and saves the respective changes and information. 

positive_words.py- The program is checking Tweets, Twitter replays, etc. form a csv file and counts positive and negative words (form text files) contained in each tweet and prints out the negative score, the positive score and the net score of each tweet. 

opencv_final_VZ.ipynb- The program takes a ZIP file of newspaper images, extractes each of them, separates the text (using tesseract to do optical character recognition) and the images (using OpenCV to detect faces), and allows one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces and returns a contact sheet (PIL used) of these images together.E.g. if you search for "pizza" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the newspaper page which mentions "pizza".
